# Team-Project
This is a repo for a projet I undertook in uni with my teammates.
My task was to design a Hygrometer.
I used the DHT11 as my sensor component.
I used Raspberry PI 3B as my development environment.
I developed to independent programs to function asynchronously.
One program interfaced with the sensor hardware to query data, known as hygrometer
Another program displayed the data through a GUI in real time, known as hygrometergui
I also merged the two programs together into a python executable, for easy execution
